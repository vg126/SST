# LLM-Derived Sentence Simplification Techniques: A Technical Compendium of Computational Linguistics Methods for Automated Text Accessibility Enhancement

## Sequence Generation and Transformation Techniques

### 1. Fine-Tuned Sequence-to-Sequence Simplification

**Fine-tuned Seq2Seq simplification** treats sentence simplification as monolingual translation using encoder-decoder Transformer architectures trained on parallel complex-simple sentence pairs. The model learns lexical substitution, sentence splitting, phrase reordering, and redundant information deletion through cross-entropy loss minimization.

**Examples:**

- "The legislative measure, promulgated subsequent to extensive deliberation, effectuated a significant alteration in fiscal policy." → "The law, created after much discussion, significantly changed tax policy."
- "Notwithstanding the inclement atmospheric conditions, the aeronautical conveyance achieved its destination punctually." → "Despite the bad weather, the airplane arrived on time."


### 2. Controllable Generation with Control Tokens

**Controllable generation** enhances Seq2Seq models by prepending special tokens that specify desired output characteristics like compression ratio, lexical complexity, or syntactic structure[^1_3]. The model learns to generate simplifications conforming to token-specified constraints.

**Examples:**

- `<COMPRESS:0.7> <LEXICAL:SIMPLE>` "The edifice's antiquated facade necessitated comprehensive refurbishment." → "The old building front needed a full repair."
- `<LENGTH:SIMILAR> <SYNTAX:SPLIT>` "Because the analysis revealed significant discrepancies, the project was halted pending further investigation." → "The analysis revealed significant differences. Therefore, the project was stopped until more investigation occurs."


## Attention and Pruning Techniques

### 3. Attention-Based Token Pruning

**Attention-based pruning** analyzes Transformer attention weights to identify tokens receiving consistently low aggregate attention scores, then removes these less salient tokens to create shorter sentences[^1_4]. Low-attention tokens are considered less critical to core meaning preservation.

**Examples:**

- "The report, which was meticulously compiled over several weeks by the dedicated research team, ultimately concluded that the initial hypothesis was untenable." → "The report concluded that the initial hypothesis was untenable."


### 4. Pruning-Inspired Constituent Deletion

**Constituent deletion** applies model pruning concepts to sentence structure by identifying and removing syntactic constituents (phrases, clauses) with minimal semantic impact[^1_5]. Importance scoring uses embedding similarity or language model probabilities.

**Examples:**

- "The defendant, a man with no prior criminal record, was found guilty by the jury after three days of deliberation." → "The defendant was found guilty by the jury after three days of deliberation."


## Semantic Representation Techniques

### 5. Embedding-Based Lexical Simplification

**Embedding-based lexical simplification** replaces complex words with simpler synonyms using contextual embeddings for semantic similarity measurement and frequency-based simplicity criteria. Context-aware substitution resolves word sense ambiguity.

**Examples:**

- "The physician ameliorated the patient's discomfort." → "The physician eased the patient's discomfort."


### 6. Vector Semantic Compression

**Vector semantic compression** encodes sentence meaning into dense embeddings, then decodes with length constraints to preserve semantic essence while reducing surface form[^1_7]. Decoder objectives balance semantic similarity with brevity promotion.

**Examples:**

- "The empirical investigation yielded results that unequivocally corroborated the initial theoretical postulations." → "The study confirmed the theory."


## Prompting-Based Techniques

### 7. Zero/Few-Shot Prompted Simplification

**Prompted simplification** instructs large language models to simplify sentences without task-specific fine-tuning[^1_8]. Zero-shot uses direct instructions; few-shot includes demonstration examples to guide output style and format.

**Examples:**

- Zero-shot: "Simplify: 'The meteorological precipitation commenced abruptly.'" → "It started raining suddenly."
- Few-shot with examples → "The paucity of resources hindered progress." → "The lack of resources slowed progress."


### 8. Chain-of-Thought Guided Simplification

**Chain-of-thought simplification** prompts LLMs to articulate step-by-step reasoning before generating simplified output[^1_9]. Explicit reasoning chains improve accuracy and provide transparency into the simplification process.

**Examples:**

- Input: "The convoluted narrative obfuscated the primary message."
- CoT reasoning: "Identify complex words → Find simpler synonyms → Select contextually appropriate terms → Reconstruct sentence"
- Output: "The confusing story hid the main message."


### 9. Iterative Refinement Prompting

**Iterative refinement** uses multi-turn conversations where LLMs critique and regenerate their own simplifications based on meaning preservation, complexity reduction, and fluency criteria[^1_10]. Sequential refinement balances competing simplification objectives.

**Examples:**

- Turn 1: "The ubiquitous nature of smartphones facilitates incessant communication." → "Smartphones being everywhere helps constant communication."
- Turn 2 (refined): "Because smartphones are everywhere, people can communicate constantly."


## Conclusion

These nine LLM-derived techniques leverage core computational mechanisms including sequence generation, attention analysis, semantic embeddings, and in-context learning for automated text simplification[^1_11]. Prompting-based methods show increasing adoption due to flexibility and reduced data requirements, while fine-tuning approaches remain valuable for domain-specific applications[^1_12]. Future development focuses on hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques and personalized simplification targeting individual user needs[^1_13].

# Child Language Acquisition-Derived Sentence Simplification Techniques: A Comprehensive Compendium of Developmentally-Inspired Computational Methods for Automated Text Accessibility Enhancement

## Structural Simplification Techniques

### 1. Function Word Omission (Telegraphic Style)

**Function word omission** systematically removes grammatical function words including articles, auxiliary verbs, prepositions, and pronouns while preserving core content words[^1_1]. This technique mirrors telegraphic speech observed in children aged 18-24 months who produce utterances like "eat cake" instead of "I want to eat cake"[^1_2].

**Examples:**

- "The fluffy cat is sleeping soundly on the warm mat." → "Fluffy cat sleep soundly warm mat."
- "I want to go to the park because it is sunny." → "Want go park. Sunny."


### 2. Core Argument Structure Preservation

**Core argument preservation** reduces sentences to essential semantic components focusing on agent-action-patient relationships while stripping away modifiers, adjuncts, and subordinate clauses[^1_3]. This reflects children's early multi-word utterances that highlight main participants and central actions like "Doggy bark" or "Want cookie"[^1_4].

**Examples:**

- "The diligent student, who had studied all night, easily passed the difficult final examination." → "Student passed examination."
- "Under the shade of the old oak tree, the children laughed while playing a game." → "Children played game."


### 3. Sentence Segmentation

**Sentence segmentation** breaks complex sentences containing multiple clauses into shorter, simpler sentences conveying single propositions[^1_5]. This mirrors Child-Directed Speech (CDS) characteristics of shorter utterances and simplified structures that aid children's language processing[^1_6].

**Examples:**

- "Although the weather was cold and windy, the team played the match, which ended in a draw after ninety minutes." → "The weather was cold. The weather was windy. The team played the match. The match ended in a draw. The match lasted ninety minutes."
- "The scientist discovered a new planet using the powerful telescope that was built last year." → "The scientist discovered a new planet. She used a powerful telescope. The telescope was built last year."


### 4. Agent-Action Focus with Semantic Bootstrapping

**Agent-action focus** restructures sentences to consistent Agent-Action-Object patterns, primarily converting passive voice to active voice[^1_7]. This technique draws from semantic bootstrapping theories proposing that children use reliable Agent-Subject mappings to decipher grammatical structure[^1_8].

**Examples:**

- "The ball was thrown by the boy." → "The boy threw the ball."
- "Important discoveries were made by the researchers." → "The researchers made important discoveries."


### 5. Explicit Subject Repetition

**Explicit subject repetition** replaces pronouns with full noun phrases across segmented sentences to reduce referential ambiguity[^1_9]. This adaptation of CDS repetition characteristics eliminates cognitive load associated with anaphora resolution[^1_10].

**Examples:**

- "The little dog barked loudly because it saw the mailman, who it didn't recognize." → "The little dog barked loudly. The little dog saw the mailman. The little dog didn't recognize the mailman."
- "Sarah finished her homework and then she went to the park." → "Sarah finished her homework. Sarah went to the park."


## Lexical and Morphological Simplification Techniques

### 6. Lexical Simplification with Frequency-Based Substitution

**Lexical simplification** replaces complex words with simpler alternatives based on frequency, concreteness, and morphological complexity criteria[^1_11]. This mirrors children's natural vocabulary acquisition trajectory from basic concrete words to abstract terms and CDS vocabulary restrictions[^1_12].

**Examples:**

- "The vehicle rapidly decelerated." → "The car slowed down quickly."
- "He endeavoured to ascertain the veracity of the statement." → "He tried to find out if the statement was true."


### 7. Morphological Reduction

**Morphological reduction** removes inflectional morphemes by using base forms of nouns, verbs, and adjectives[^1_13]. This technique directly mirrors early child language patterns where children frequently omit necessary inflectional morphemes before mastering the morphological system[^1_14].

**Examples:**

- "The dogs barked loudly at the arriving cars." → "Dog bark loud at arrive car."
- "She carefully opened the painted boxes." → "She careful open paint box."


### 8. Rule Generalization (Over-regularization Adaptation)

**Rule generalization** applies common productive grammatical rules universally, including to irregular forms, prioritizing predictability over grammatical correctness[^1_15]. This adapts the over-regularization phenomenon observed in children aged 2-5 who produce forms like "goed" and "foots"[^1_16].

**Examples:**

- "The children went to the zoo and saw two mice." → "The childs goed to the zoo and seed two mouses."
- "He brought food that she had eaten." → "He bringed food that she eated."


## Advanced Developmental Techniques

### 9. Bootstrapping-Enhanced Structure Mapping

**Bootstrapping structure mapping** combines semantic and syntactic bootstrapping principles to restructure sentences for optimal meaning-form correspondence[^1_17]. This technique ensures consistent mapping between semantic roles and syntactic positions while maintaining developmental accessibility patterns.

**Examples:**

- "The mystery was solved by the detective after careful investigation." → "The detective solved the mystery. The detective investigated carefully."
- "Due to heavy rainfall, the picnic was cancelled by the organizers." → "Rain fell heavily. The organizers cancelled the picnic."


### 10. Progressive Complexity Staging

**Progressive complexity staging** applies multiple techniques in developmental sequence, starting with most basic simplifications and gradually introducing complexity[^1_18]. This mirrors children's staged language acquisition from telegraphic speech through morphological development.

**Examples:**

- Stage 1: "Dog run fast" (telegraphic)
- Stage 2: "The dog run fast" (articles added)
- Stage 3: "The dog runs fast" (morphology added)


## Conclusion

These ten child language acquisition-derived techniques leverage fundamental developmental mechanisms including telegraphic speech patterns, semantic bootstrapping, morphological emergence patterns, and CDS characteristics for systematic text simplification[^1_19]. The techniques span structural reorganization, lexical accessibility enhancement, and morphological standardization while maintaining grounding in established developmental research[^1_20]. Implementation requires careful consideration of target audience capabilities and the inherent trade-offs between grammatical correctness and processing ease that characterize developmental language patterns[^1_21]. Future applications may benefit from hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques in developmentally-informed sequences[^1_22].

# Comprehensive List of Sentence Simplification Techniques for Cognitive Accessibility

Below is a detailed compilation of evidence-based sentence simplification techniques designed to reduce cognitive load and improve text accessibility across various needs, including dyslexia, ADHD, and general reading comprehension difficulties.

## Easy-to-Read Methodologies

1. **Short Sentence Construction**
Short sentences express only one idea and break complex information into smaller, easier-to-process units. Keep sentences under 15-20 words for optimal comprehension.

*Example:*
    - Complex: "Once the candidate's goals are established, one or more potential employers are identified and a preliminary proposal for presentation to the employer is developed."
    - Simplified: "Once we establish your goals, we identify potential employers. Then we prepare a proposal."[^1_5]
2. **Active Voice Usage**
Active voice keeps the subject performing the action, making sentences more direct and easier to understand. This structure follows natural thought patterns and reduces processing time.

*Example:*
    - Passive: "Your form was mailed by us on May 1."
    - Active: "We mailed your form on May 1."[^1_11]
3. **Sentence Splitting**
This technique breaks long, complex sentences with multiple clauses into separate, simpler sentences. It originated in text simplification systems and helps maintain clear thought boundaries.

*Example:*
    - Complex: "If you take less than your entitled share of production for any month, but you pay royalties on the full volume, you will owe no additional royalty when you later take more to balance your account."
    - Split: "Suppose that one month you pay royalties on your full share. In this case, you won't owe more when you later take extra to balance your account."[^1_5]

## Dyslexia-Friendly Structuring

4. **Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts**
Sans-serif fonts with evenly spaced letters reduce visual stress and prevent letter confusion for dyslexic readers. Popular choices include Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, and specialized fonts like OpenDyslexic.

*Example:* Use Verdana 12-14pt with character spacing at approximately 35% of average letter width rather than compressed fonts.[^1_2][^1_9]
5. **Visual Chunking**
Breaking text into visually distinct sections using color, spacing, and formatting helps readers process information in manageable units. This technique reduces the cognitive load of tracking position within text.

*Example:* Using different colors for key terms or concepts; leaving extra space between paragraphs; using background shading for different sections.[^1_9]
6. **Consistent Line Spacing**
Increased line spacing (1.5 or greater) prevents lines from visually merging and helps readers track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. This technique is especially helpful for maintaining reading flow.

*Example:* Setting line spacing to 1.5 and ensuring inter-word spacing is at least 3.5 times the inter-letter spacing.[^1_2]

## Plain Language Movement Standards

7. **Everyday Word Usage**
Replace complex, technical, or uncommon words with simple, familiar alternatives that most readers will understand. This technique derives from Plain Language guidelines developed for government communications.

*Example:*
    - Complex: "The physician administered the medication."
    - Simple: "The doctor gave the medicine."[^1_7][^1_11]
8. **Subject-Verb-Object Proximity**
Keep the subject, verb, and object close together to create a clear action sequence that's easier to process. This structure reduces the cognitive load of holding sentence elements in working memory.

*Example:*
    - Separated: "The applicant, after completing all required forms and waiting the mandatory processing period, received approval."
    - Proximate: "The applicant received approval after completing all required forms."[^1_20]
9. **First Position Important Information**
Place the most important information at the beginning of the sentence, paragraph, or document. This technique, from journalism and government communication standards, ensures key points aren't missed.

*Example:*
    - Original: "In the event that you qualify under Section 4.3 of the policy, benefits may be available."
    - Improved: "Benefits may be available if you qualify under Section 4.3 of the policy."[^1_7][^1_11]

## Cognitive Load Reduction Strategies

10. **One Idea Per Sentence**
Limit each sentence to expressing only one complete thought or concept. This technique prevents working memory overload by compartmentalizing ideas.

*Example:*
    - Multiple ideas: "The company announced record profits last quarter despite supply chain issues, while also revealing plans for expansion into Asian markets."
    - One idea per sentence: "The company announced record profits last quarter despite supply chain issues. They also revealed plans for expansion into Asian markets."[^1_5][^1_20]
11. **Elimination of Double Negatives**
Replace sentences containing double negatives with positive statements that express the same meaning. This reduces processing complexity by removing the need for multiple logical inversions.

*Example:*
    - Double negative: "It is not uncommon for patients to not experience symptoms."
    - Positive form: "Patients often have no symptoms."[^1_20]
12. **Working Memory Support**
Structure text to minimize demands on working memory by limiting embedded clauses and providing context before new information. This technique is based on cognitive load theory research.

*Example:*
    - High memory load: "The legal implications of the decision, which contradicted previous rulings from lower courts about jurisdictional boundaries, surprised experts."
    - Reduced load: "Experts were surprised by the legal implications of the decision. It contradicted previous rulings from lower courts about jurisdictional boundaries."[^1_3]

## Visual/Spatial Organization Techniques

13. **Hierarchical Headings**
Use clear, descriptive headings in a consistent hierarchical structure to organize content and create visual "signposts." This technique helps readers navigate content and locate specific information.

*Example:* Using headings that are at least 20% larger than body text, with extra space before and after to create clear visual separation between sections.[^1_2][^1_9]
14. **Bullet Point Transformation**
Convert complex paragraphs with multiple elements into bulleted or numbered lists. This technique, common in technical writing and instructional design, transforms dense text into scannable information.

*Example:*
    - Paragraph: "To register, you need to complete the form, attach a photo ID, provide proof of address, and include payment of the registration fee."
    - List:
        * Complete the form
        * Attach a photo ID
        * Provide proof of address
        * Include payment of registration fee[^1_11]

## Attention-Deficit Accommodating Structures

15. **Minimalist Interface Text**
Remove all extraneous elements and visual distractions surrounding the core text. This technique, derived from studies of ADHD-friendly interfaces, helps maintain focus on essential content.

*Example:* Using a clean reading environment with minimal menus, toolbars, or sidebars; avoiding decorative elements that don't contribute to meaning.[^1_8]
16. **Chunking with Visual Breaks**
Insert explicit visual breaks between conceptual sections of text using horizontal rules, color blocks, or extra white space. This technique helps readers with attention difficulties maintain their place and focus.

*Example:* Using horizontal lines to separate distinct topics; alternating subtle background colors between sections; creating distinct "cards" for different concepts.[^1_4][^1_8]

## Reading Level Adjustment Methods

17. **Simplified Syntax Patterns**
Replace complex syntactic structures with simple, predictable patterns that follow basic subject-verb-object order. This technique reduces the cognitive effort needed to parse sentence structure.

*Example:*
    - Complex: "Having been notified of the impending deadline, participants were expected to accelerate their efforts."
    - Simplified: "We told participants about the deadline. They needed to work faster."[^1_20]
18. **Flesch-Kincaid Level Targeting**
Adjust vocabulary, sentence length, and structure to target specific Flesch-Kincaid reading grade levels appropriate for the intended audience. This technique originated in educational materials development.

*Example:* Revising a college-level text (FK 12-15) to middle school level (FK 6-9) by shortening sentences, simplifying vocabulary, and using more direct syntax.[^1_6]

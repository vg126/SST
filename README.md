# SST
Herein is a list of Sentence simplification, transformation, mapping etc. techniques. Ideal format for the final SST. Most files do follow the ideal format but each domain being different, there is no one size fits all. The size of the description block may vary by technique and domain. But the format of Serial Number within Domain, Name, Description, Examples must be followed


Serial Number per domain._Name of Technique
Description block of the technique. Should contain what the technique is, its core purpose in whichever domain its used in and anything else in this block must be such that it serves this goal. 
Examples: While 2 is the norm for most and is a minimum, for something that may be complex, it can be expanded

No specific file has been pointed to as being ideal, intentionally to not fit that file on to the rest. Each technique deserves its own treatment.

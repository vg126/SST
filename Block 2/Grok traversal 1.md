	# Summary of Transformation and Simplification Techniques

## Traversal and Ordering Techniques
1. **Inorder Traversal**: Visits binary tree nodes (left, root, right) to produce a sorted sequence.  
   - Example: BST (2: root, 1: left, 3: right) yields [1, 2, 3].
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores graph nodes level by level using a queue.  
   - Example: Graph (A -> B, C; B -> D, E) yields [A, B, C, D, E].
3. **Quicksort**: Partitions array around a pivot and recursively sorts subarrays.  
   - Example: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] sorts to [1, 1, 3, 4, 5].
4. **Binary Search**: Divides sorted array to find a target efficiently.  
   - Example: Finds 7 in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] at index 3.

## Data Restructuring Techniques
5. **Array Rotation**: Shifts array elements cyclically by reversing segments.  
   - Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] left by 2 becomes [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].
6. **Linked List Reversal**: Reverses node pointers to change list direction.  
   - Example: 1 -> 2 -> 3 becomes 3 -> 2 -> 1.
7. **Heapify Operation**: Maintains heap property by swapping nodes.  
   - Example: Max-heap [10, 5, 3] with 15 becomes [15, 5, 3, 10].

## Data Access and Management Techniques
8. **Hash Table Lookup**: Maps keys to indices for fast retrieval.  
   - Example: “Alice” -> “123-4567” stored at hash(“Alice”) = 3.
9. **Set Union**: Combines sets, removing duplicates.  
   - Example: {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

## Processing and Compression Techniques
10. **Stack-based Evaluation**: Evaluates postfix expressions using a stack.  
    - Example: “3 4 + 5 *” computes to 35.
11. **String Reversal**: Swaps characters to reverse string order.  
    - Example: “hello” becomes “olleh”.
12. **Huffman Coding**: Assigns variable-length codes based on character frequencies.  
    - Example: ‘a’(5), ‘b’(2), ‘c’(1) encoded as ‘a’:0, ‘b’:10, ‘c’:11.

## Simulated Novel Techniques
13. **Adaptive Tree Balancing**: Rebalances tree based on node access frequency.  
    - Example: Moves frequently accessed node 10 closer to BST root.
14. **Graph Compression via Community Detection**: Represents graph communities as single nodes.  
    - Example: Social network with 100 nodes compresses to 10 community nodes.

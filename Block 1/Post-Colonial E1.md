# Post-Colonial Discourse-Derived Sentence Simplification Techniques: A Comprehensive Compendium of Critical Linguistic Methods for Decolonial Text Accessibility Enhancement

## Agency and Voice Clarification Techniques

### 1. Active Voice Conversion

**Active voice conversion** transforms passive constructions to active voice structures, explicitly revealing agents and actions while eliminating obscured responsibility[^1_1]. This Critical Discourse Analysis technique exposes power relations by making clear who performs actions rather than hiding agency through passive phrasing.

**Examples:**

- "It was decided that the land would be reclaimed" → "The council decided to reclaim the land"
- "Mistakes were made during the operation" → "The commander made mistakes during the operation"


### 2. Nominalization Reversal

**Nominalization reversal** converts abstract noun forms back to concrete action verbs, revealing hidden agents and making processes explicit[^1_2]. This technique eliminates bureaucratic abstraction that conceals responsibility by transforming actions into things.

**Examples:**

- "The implementation of the policy was done by the committee" → "The committee implemented the policy"
- "There was an assessment of the situation by the officials" → "The officials assessed the situation"


## Structural Simplification Techniques

### 3. Complex Sentence Segmentation

**Complex sentence segmentation** divides multi-clause sentences into shorter, standalone units handling single propositions[^1_3]. This technique prevents cognitive overload while ensuring accessibility across diverse educational backgrounds and linguistic competencies.

**Examples:**

- "In 1970, after years of strife and negotiations, the country achieved independence, establishing a new government that aimed to rectify historical injustices while facing the challenges of forming a stable economy" → "In 1970, after years of strife and negotiations, the country achieved independence. The new government aimed to rectify historical injustices while working to build a stable economy"


## Lexical and Cultural Adaptation Techniques

### 4. Plain Language Substitution

**Plain language substitution** replaces academic jargon, bureaucratic terminology, and Eurocentric vocabulary with accessible common words[^1_4]. This decolonial practice ensures linguistic inclusivity by removing barriers created by specialized insider terminology.

**Examples:**

- "It is incumbent upon the local populace to commence utilization of the facility" → "The local people must start using the facility"
- "The implementation necessitates comprehensive stakeholder engagement" → "The plan requires talking with all affected people"


### 5. Cultural Term Clarification

**Cultural term clarification** provides immediate explanations or translations for unfamiliar technical, foreign, or culturally-specific terminology[^1_5]. This technique ensures no reader exclusion based on specialized knowledge while maintaining original precision.

**Examples:**

- "The land was declared terra nullius" → "The land was declared terra nullius (treating the land as belonging to no one)"
- "They implemented an akratic approach" → "They implemented an approach lacking self-control (akratic)"


### 6. Euphemism Elimination

**Euphemism elimination** replaces indirect, sanitized language with direct, literal descriptions of actual meaning[^1_6]. This post-colonial technique exposes how power structures use gentle wording to conceal harsh realities and maintain ideological control.

**Examples:**

- "Pacification campaign" → "Military takeover"
- "Collateral damage" → "Civilian casualties"
- "Enhanced interrogation techniques" → "Torture methods"


## Rhetorical and Stylistic Techniques

### 7. Hedge Reduction

**Hedge reduction** removes excessive qualifying language and uncertainty markers that obscure clear communication[^1_7]. While acknowledging legitimate uncertainty, this technique eliminates academic hedging that makes sentences indecisive and difficult to parse.

**Examples:**

- "It could be argued that the policy was somewhat effective in certain respects" → "The policy was partly effective"
- "Perhaps it might be suggested that there could be some improvement" → "The system needs improvement"


### 8. Redundancy Elimination

**Redundancy elimination** removes doubled phrases, unnecessary filler words, and verbose constructions characteristic of official and colonial-era prose[^1_8]. This technique creates leaner sentences with immediate, unambiguous meaning.

**Examples:**

- "In order to ensure the future continuation of the project, we must collaborate together as a group" → "To ensure the project continues, we must collaborate"
- "At this point in time, we are currently conducting an investigation into the matter" → "We are investigating the matter"


## Conclusion

These eight post-colonial discourse-derived techniques address systemic linguistic barriers rooted in power structures, cultural exclusion, and rhetorical obfuscation[^1_9]. The integration of Critical Discourse Analysis methods with decolonial language practices creates comprehensive accessibility enhancement while exposing hidden ideological mechanisms[^1_10]. Implementation requires sensitivity to cultural contexts and recognition that linguistic simplification serves broader goals of democratized knowledge access and social justice[^1_11]. These techniques particularly benefit communities historically marginalized by academic and institutional language barriers[^1_12].

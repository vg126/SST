# Comprehensive List of Sentence Simplification Techniques for Syntax Restructuring

The following list presents established and emerging techniques for sentence simplification through syntactic restructuring. These approaches systematically modify complex grammatical structures while preserving core meaning, essentially performing "syntax surgery" on text.

## Clause-Level Techniques

### 1. Subordinate Clause Reduction

This technique eliminates subordinate clauses when the subject of the subordinate clause matches the subject of the main clause. It removes redundant subjects and sometimes auxiliary verbs to create more concise sentences.

- **Example:** "Before we left for work, we ate breakfast." → "Before leaving for work, we ate breakfast."
- **Example:** "Although she was nervous about the test, she got a good grade." → "Although nervous about the test, she got a good grade."[^1_11]


### 2. Sentence Deletion Based on Discourse Structure

This approach analyzes document-level discourse factors to identify and remove sentences that are less essential while preserving the overall meaning. It uses functional discourse structure that categorizes sentences based on their content and role in the text.

- **Example:** "The event took place in Paris. Paris is the capital of France. Many attendees were impressed by the organization." → "The event took place in Paris. Many attendees were impressed by the organization."[^1_9][^1_15]


### 3. Extraposition Construction Management

This technique handles "it" extraposition constructions by moving clauses from subject position to the right of the verb while replacing them with "it". It distinguishes between two types of extraposition constructions with different syntactic behaviors.

- **Example:** "That the teacher was lying was hardly obvious." → "It was hardly obvious that the teacher was lying."[^1_5]


## Syntactic Structure Techniques

### 4. Dependency-Based Simplification (DEPSYM)

This lightweight syntactic simplification algorithm uses the dependency parse tree of a complex sentence for simplification and splitting. It targets the improvement of readability while preserving grammaticality and meaning.

- **Example:** "Although he was very tired, John decided to go to the party that was organized by his best friend." → "John was very tired. John decided to go to the party. The party was organized by his best friend."[^1_6]


### 5. Syntactic Tree Pruning

This technique systematically prunes parts of the syntactic tree while preserving core semantics and crucial information. It operates on the insight that a pruned sentence should maintain similar crucial semantics compared to the original sentence.

- **Example:** "The tall man who wore a red hat and carried a black umbrella walked quickly down the street." → "The man walked down the street."[^1_7]


### 6. Entity-Focused Sentence Simplification

This approach simplifies sentences specifically to improve relation extraction by focusing on entities and their relationships. It applies simplification rules using Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar to make sentences more amenable to relation extraction.

- **Example:** "The protein, which was discovered in 1982, interacts with DNA and regulates gene expression in the nucleus of the cell." → "The protein interacts with DNA. The protein regulates gene expression."[^1_8][^1_13]


### 7. Controlled Operation Classification

This technique classifies sentences for different operations: rephrasing vs. copying, and splitting based on syntactic vs. discourse structure. It creates tailored simplifications based on these classifications, improving control over the simplification process.

- **Example (Syntactic Split):** "The man, who was wearing a hat, entered the building." → "The man entered the building. The man was wearing a hat."
- **Example (Discourse Split):** "Although it was raining, they went for a walk." → "It was raining. Nevertheless, they went for a walk."[^1_14]


### 8. Dynamic Multi-Level Task-Based Simplification

This approach uses multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks of entailment and paraphrase generation to improve simplification. It employs a novel layered soft sharing approach where auxiliary tasks share different levels of the simplification model.

- **Example:** "The investigation revealed that the suspect, who had previously been convicted of similar crimes, had carefully planned the robbery." → "The suspect had planned the robbery. The suspect had been convicted of similar crimes before."[^1_16]


## Simulated Techniques

### 9. Simulated: Predicate Flattening

This simulated technique transforms complex predicates into simpler ones by breaking down multi-part verb phrases. It simplifies tense structures and reduces auxiliary verbs while maintaining the core verbal meaning.

- **Example:** "The committee has been considering the proposal for several months." → "The committee considered the proposal for months."
- **Example:** "She might have been trying to contact him." → "She tried to contact him."


### 10. Simulated: Complex Modifier Elimination

This simulated technique identifies and removes or simplifies complex modifiers such as nested prepositional phrases or adjective clauses. It preserves the head noun and essential modifiers while eliminating non-critical descriptive elements.

- **Example:** "The man with the hat from the store across the street came in." → "The man with the hat came in."
- **Example:** "The book, which was written by a famous author who lives in Paris, was published last year." → "The book was written by a famous author. It was published last year."


## Conclusion

These ten techniques represent diverse approaches to sentence simplification through syntactic restructuring. While each focuses on different aspects of sentence structure, they all share the goal of reducing syntactic complexity while preserving essential meaning. The field continues to evolve with new approaches combining linguistic rules and machine learning to achieve more natural and context-aware simplifications.
